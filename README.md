The current repository hosts the **waldi** R package that provides methods to compute location-adjusted Wald statistics for popular model classes included `glm`.

The methodology comes from the paper

Di Caterina, Claudia and Kosmidis, Ioannis (2017). Location-Adjusted Wald Statistic for Scalar Parameters. ArXiv E-Prints. [arXiv:1710.11217](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11217).

whose supplementary material is in [`inst/supplementary_1710-11217`](https://github.com/ikosmidis/waldi/tree/master/inst/supplementary_1710-11217). The code to reproduce the numerical results is also given in [waldi_1_supplementary_code.pdf](https://github.com/ikosmidis/waldi/blob/master/inst/supplementary_1710-11217/waldi_1_supplementary_code.pdf).
